# Asynchronous patterns in Node.js

## A common problem and solution

First, let's see the problem we're trying to avoid:

Let's start by creating a few files in a brand new directory. Use the name of the files below and the contents as described for this example. The numeric names of the file are used to help clarify the point being made.

0.html
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Joe Andaverde</span>
<p class="bio">Joe is a Software Engineer for Softek Solutions, Inc. He's passionate about sharing his knowledge with others.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

1.html
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Dusty Burwell</span>
<p class="bio">Dusty is a dude.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
    if (err) return;

    var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
    
    if (matches) {
        var name = matches[1];
        var bio = matches[2];
        fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

The problem here is the callback from read file doesn't actually get executed until the loop has completed. In which case, with the name being the integer value of the loop all files are saved with the terminating value of i. 

How do we avoid this? The important concept here is how scope is handled in JavaScript. Unlike other languages with block level scope using curly braces JavaScript's scope is at a function level only. We could get around this problem by introducing a new scope in each iteration of the loop to capture the value of i at that moment.

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  (function (i) { //Create a new scope that takes a single argument

      fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
        if (err) return;

        var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
        
        if (matches) {
            var name = matches[1];
            var bio = matches[2];
            fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
        }
      });

  })(i);//Execute this function with the current value of i
}
{% endhighlight %}

The lesson to be learned here is that scopes are your best friend when performing asynchronous actions in JavaScript.
