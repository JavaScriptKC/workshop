## A nice text editor

A good text editor is essential for completing these labs. I recommend Sublime Text because it is cross-platform, free, and has a very simple to use interface:

### WebStorm

If you want a more powerful Integrated Development Environment try WebStorm:

## Telnet for Windows or Cygwin

It may help to be able to connect to your application from a command prompt. For this you need a tool like nc (linux) or telnet (windows). I recommend to install Cygwin over whatever windows has to offer.
