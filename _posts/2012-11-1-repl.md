# The Node.js REPL

In this lab you'll learn how to use the node.js REPL (read-eval-print loop) to execute ad-hoc JavaScript statements. By the end you should be comfortable using the REPL and defining strings, objects, arrays, and functions in JavaScript.

- [Starting the node.js REPL and executing statements](#starting_the_nodejs_repl_and_executing_statements)
- [Interacting with arrays](#interacting_with_arrays)
- [Interacting with objects](#interacting_with_objects)
- [Creating and calling functions](#creating_and_calling_functions)
- [Multi-line statements in the REPL](#multiline_statements_in_the_repl)
- [Exiting the node.js REPL](#exiting_the_nodejs_repl)

## Starting the Node.js REPL and Executing Statements

To launch the node.js REPL open a command prompt or terminal and execute ```node```. Once open, evaluate a few simple expressions:

{% highlight javascript %}
> 1 + 5
6

> var add = function (a, b) { return a + b; }
undefined

> add(1, 5)
6
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the result of the statement executed is printed on the following line without ```>```. If you made a typo you can cancel your statement by pressing ```CTRL+C``` once.

If you forgot to assign the value of the previously executed statement, the node.js REPL provides a useful syntax to access the previous result through ```_```.

{% highlight javascript %}
> "Node.js Rocks!"
'Node.js Rocks!'

> _
'Node.js Rocks!'

> var lastResult = _
undefined

> lastResult
'Node.js Rocks!'
{% endhighlight %}

## Interacting with Arrays

A major difference between arrays in JavaScript and many other languages is that they are mutable and the size is not required upon creation. Use the array initializer (or array syntax) to create arrays:

{% highlight javascript %}
> [1, 2]
[1, 2]

> [1,2].length
2
{% endhighlight %}

Adding an item to an array existing array:

{% highlight javascript %}
> var a =  ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']
undefined

> a.length
3

> a.push("lemon")
4 // `push` returns the size of the array after the push operation completes

> a.unshift("lime")
5 // `unshift` adds an element to the beginning of the array and returns the new length
{% endhighlight %}

Now inspect the contents of your array:

{% highlight javascript %}
> a
[ 'lime',
  'apple',
  'banana',
  'kiwi',
  'lemon' ]
{% endhighlight %}

Removing an item from an array:

{% highlight javascript %}
> a.pop()
'lemon' // `pop` removes and returns the last value in the array.

> a.shift()
'lime' // `shift` removes and returns the first value in the array.
{% endhighlight %}

The `slice` function can be used to copy a portion of an array to a new array. It does not modify the original array, rather, it copies it and returns a portion. It takes two arguments: a start index and end index. The end index is not inclusive.

{% highlight javascript %}
> a
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']

> a.slice(0, 1)
['apple']

> a
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi'] // the original array is not changed.

> a.slice(0)
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi'] // copies the entire array.
{% endhighlight %}

## Interacting with Objects

Create a new object using the object initializer (or object syntax). Properties can be set using the dot operator:

{% highlight javascript %}
> var o = {}
undefined

> o.foo
undefined

> o.foo = 'bar'
'bar'

> o.foo.length
3
{% endhighlight %}

If needed, the array syntax can allow you to create properties on objects that would otherwise be impossible to access using the dot syntax above. An interesting note here is that objects in javascript can have any value as keys, not just strings or numbers.

{% highlight javascript %}
> o['foo.bar'] = 'things'
'things'

> o['foo.bar']
'things'
{% endhighlight %}

The array syntax `o['foo']` and the dot syntax `o.foo` can be used interchangably.

Objects can be composed of other objects:

{% highlight javascript %}
> o.bar = [1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4]

> o.bar.length
4

> o.foobar = function () { return 'foo bar!'; }
[Function]

> o.foobar()
'foo bar!'

> o['foobar']()
'foo bar!'
{% endhighlight %}

## Creating and Calling Functions

JavaScript functions are declared using the ```function``` keyword. This will create functions called foo and bar that do nothing:

{% highlight javascript %}
> var foo = function () {} // this syntax is known as a `function expression`
undefined

> foo
[Function]

> function bar () {} // this syntax is known as a `function declaration`
undefined

> bar
[Function: bar]
{% endhighlight %}

Both function declarations and expressions define functions the same way. If you use a function declaration, it may be possible to call the function in your code in lines of code above where it is defined. This practice is not recommended.

It's recommended to always use function expressions unless you understand function hoisting ([further reading](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting.html)). Feel free to grab an instructor if you'd like more information.

Functions that do not have a name are anonymous. For example, ```function () { }``` is considered anonymous. These are commonly used as callback arguments to other functions.

{% highlight javascript %}
// declare a function that takes a callback argument
> var foo = function (callback) {
...     callback();
... }
undefined

// passing an anonymous function as a callback
> foo(function () {
...     // callback function body
... });
undefined
{% endhighlight %}

## Multi-line Statements in the REPL

You may have noticed that the node.js REPL allows for multi-line statements to be executed. When a line cannot be processed as a complete JavaScript statement the node.js REPL prompts for more input, as demonstrated when starting a function declaration above.

The ```...``` indicates that the node.js REPL expects more input. ```CTRL+C``` can be used to cancel the multi-line statement if it was made in error.

Now, define a multi-line function and execute it:

{% highlight javascript %}
> var boo = function () {
...     return "Hello World!";
... }
undefined

> boo()
'Hello World!'
{% endhighlight %}

## Exiting the Node.js REPL

Exiting the node.js REPL can be done by keyboard interrupt or exiting the process.

To exit by keyboard interrupt, press ```CTRL+C``` twice.

To instruct the node.js process to exit:

{% highlight javascript %}
> process.exit()
{% endhighlight %}
