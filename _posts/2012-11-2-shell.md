# A Node.js Shell

In this lab we'll put together a simple shell. We'll interact with the file system and learn some useful facets of the JavaScript programming language.

- [Working with standard input](#working_with_standard_input)
- [Implementing a print working directory command](#implementing_a_print_working_directory_command)
- [Interacting with the filesystem: reading a directory](#interacting_with_the_filesystem_reading_a_directory)
- [Interacting with HTTP: downloading a file](#interacting_with_http_downloading_a_file)

# Working with Standard Input

Commands will be provided to our shell through the process' standard input. By default, Node.js does not activate the standard input stream. The first thing we'll do is enable standard input and echo back what we read.

Create a new file called `shell.js` and add the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var stdin = process.openStdin();

stdin.on('data', function (input) {
  console.log(input);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Before we go any further, let's experiment with what the above code does. Run the file:

{% highlight bash %}
$ node shell.js
{% endhighlight %}

Type anything and press enter. Notice that the input is line buffered (the data is sent in to Node.js every time you press enter). To shut down the process press `CTRL+C`. 

The output of your program might look something like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
foo
<Buffer 61 73 64 0a>
bar
<Buffer 62 61 72 0a>
{% endhighlight %}

You can see that we're printing out a `Buffer` object. That's because the `input` variable passed in to our `function (input) { ... }` callback does not contain the string value of your input directly.

It's worth noting that, at this point, the buffer exists completely outside of the JavaScript memory space (the `Buffer` is an object from the C++ Node.js internals). Interacting with this buffer will move data across the native to JavaScript boundary. For example, calling `input.toString()` will create a new JavaScript string containing the entire contents of the `Buffer`. An optional encoding can be specified as the first argument of the `toString` function (for example, `input.toString('utf8')`). 

Since we're working with relatively short strings, let's go ahead and call `input.toString()` on the Buffer. Here's what your program should look like now:

{% highlight javascript %}
var stdin = process.openStdin();

stdin.on('data', function (input) {
  console.log(input.toString());
});
{% endhighlight %}

Now starting up the shell and typing any value will result in the expected output ending with the new line character.

The next step is to parse the input string. The commands in our simple shell will take the form:

{% highlight bash %}
command [args...]
{% endhighlight %}

We can use a handy regular expression to separate the arguments from the command: `/(\w+)(.*)/`. We'll then parse our arguments by splitting on white space.

{% highlight javascript %}
var stdin = process.openStdin();

stdin.on('data', function (input) {
  var matches = input.toString().match(/(\w+)(.*)/);
  var command = matches[1].toLowerCase();
  var args = matches[2].trim().split(/\s+/);
});
{% endhighlight %}

#### A quick side note 
The result of `'some string'.split(/\s+/)` is an array `['some', 'string']`. 

This example could have been done with `'some string'.split(' ')`, except that would not account for other types of white space or multiple white space characters. For example:

<p><code>'some&nbsp;&nbsp;string'.split(' ')</code> would result in <code>['some', '', 'string']</code>.</p>

#### Back to the action

Feel free to check out the result of the above code block by logging out the value of `command` and `args`. You may want to add a little more logic to make this resilient to malformed input. But we'll leave that exercise up to you.

## Implementing a Print Working Directory Command

`pwd` is a simple little program to print out the current working directory. Let's implement this in our shell. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var stdin = process.openStdin();

var commands = {
  'pwd': function () {
    console.log(process.cwd());
  }
};

stdin.on('data', function (input) {
  var matches = input.toString().match(/(\w+)(.*)/);
  var command = matches[1].toLowerCase();
  var args = matches[2].trim().split(/\s+/);

  commands[command](args);
});
{% endhighlight %}

To clarify what's happening above, here's sample output of executing the regular expression at the Node.js REPL. The input is `cmd_name arg1 arg2`. 

{% highlight javascript %}
> var input = 'cmd_name arg1 arg2'
'cmd_name arg1 arg2'
> var matches = input.match(/(\w+)(.*)/)
> matches
[ 'cmd_name arg1 arg2',        // matches[0]
  'cmd_name',                  // matches[1]
  ' arg1 arg2',                // matches[2]
  index: 0,                    // matches[3]
  input: 'cmd_name arg1 arg2'] // matches[4]
{% endhighlight %}

We are accessing ```matches[1]``` because it's the first group (groups are specified with the parenthesis). If you are unfamiliar with regular expressions, a good source to learn more is at [http://regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info/).

Now, jump back to your terminal and give our shell a try!

Start up the shell with the `node` command and execute our one and only command: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ node shell.js
pwd
/users/you/simple-shell/
{% endhighlight %}

## Interacting with the file system: Reading a Directory

The command `ls [directory]` prints the contents of a directory. If the directory argument is not specified it will print the contents of the current working directory.

First, we'll import the `fs` module at the top of the file just before `var stdin = process.openStdin();`. The `fs` module is the Node.js core module for file system operations.

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
{% endhighlight %}

To implement `ls`, add a new property to our commands object named 'ls':

{% highlight javascript %}
var commands = {
  'pwd': function () {
    console.log(process.cwd());
  }, // <----------------------- Don't forget this comma!
  'ls': function (args) { //     New property added here.
    fs.readdir(args[0] || process.cwd(), function (err, entries) {
      entries.forEach(function (e) {
        console.log(e);
      });
    });
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Let's talk for a moment about `args[0] || process.cwd()`:

Unlike many other languages, JavaScript doesn't care if you access an index out of bounds of an array. If an element does not exist at the requested index, `undefined` will be returned. Since `undefined` is considered false, Using the `x || y` syntax will test the existence of `x` and if it is false (doesn't exist), it will evaluate to `y`. This is a common pattern for assigning a default value.

There are plenty of other commands available to access the file system. Feel free to [peruse the documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) and implement any other commands that interest you.

Here's more-or-less what your program should look like:

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var stdin = process.openStdin();

var commands = {
  'pwd': function () {
    console.log(process.cwd());
  },
  'ls': function (args) {
    fs.readdir(args[0] || process.cwd(), function (err, entries) {
      entries.forEach(function (e) {
        console.log(e);
      });
    });
  }
};

stdin.on('data', function (input) {
  var matches = input.toString().match(/(\w+)(.*)/);
  var command = matches[1].toLowerCase();
  var args = matches[2].trim().split(/\s+/);

  commands[command](args);
});
{% endhighlight %}

#### As a side note about our commands object

The commands object can get a bit hairy when we're nesting so many brackets deep. We can instead define our commands object like so:

{% highlight javascript %}
var commands = {};

commands['pwd'] = function () {
  console.log(process.cwd());
};

commands['ls'] = function (args) {
  fs.readdir(args[0] || process.cwd(), function (err, entries) {
    entries.forEach(function (e) {
      console.log(e);
    });
  });
};
{% endhighlight %}

## Interacting with HTTP: Downloading a File

Similarly to the `fs` module, Node.js also contains a core `http` module which can be used to act as a HTTP client or server. In the next lab you'll be creating a HTTP server, but for now, we'll focus on creating a simple `wget` command to download a file.

Import the `http` module up top next to where you imported `fs`:

{% highlight javascript %}
var http = require('http');
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we'll use `http.get(url, callback)` to make a HTTP GET request and download the results to the file system. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var commands = {
  'pwd': ... , // omitted for brevity
  'ls': ... ,  // omitted for brevity
  'wget': function (args) {
    var url = args[0];
    var file = args[1] || 'download';

    http.get(url, function (res) {
      var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream(file);
      res.pipe(writeStream);

      res.on('end', function () {
        console.log(url + ' downloaded to file \'' + file + '\'');
      });
    });
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

Let's talk about what's happening in the callback provided to `http.get` callback. 

First, we're creating a [writable stream](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable) to our file system using [fs.createWriteStream](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_createwritestream_path_options), named `file` (the second argument, or `'download'` by default). This will create or overwrite the file.

Next, let's talk about `res.pipe(writeStream);`. The `res` (response) object given to us isn't the full HTTP response. Since the response may be large, Node.js gives us the response as soon as it can be useful: after the HTTP handshake has occurred. We have access to the complete set of HTTP headers at this point, but do not have access to the data from the response.

The response data is streamed, much like the standard input stream we opened to read commands from the terminal. The `res` object emits `res.on('data')` and `res.on('end')` events, which can be directly piped out to our writable stream, saving chunks of data to the file system and then ending the write.

Once you've implemented the `wget` command, use it to unlock your next lab:

{% highlight bash %}
$ node shell.js
wget http://nodelabs.herokuapp.com/your-username/shell.html
http://nodelabs.herokuapp.com/your-username/shell.html downloaded to 'download'
{% endhighlight %}

If you get stuck, check the [manual on the HTTP module](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html) or flag down an instructor.
