# Using and Creating Modules

In the last two labs, you've `required` the 'fs' and 'http' modules to get some stuff done. Now let's see how require works and create a module of our own.

* [How do modules work?](#how_do_modules_work)
* [Require a node module](#require_a_node_module)
* [Require a JSON file](#require_a_json_file)
* [Require a core module](#require_a_core_module)
* [Require a module from the node_modules directory](#require_a_module_from_the_node_modules_directory)


## How do modules work?

In node, modules work by exporting methods or values.  If this were visualized in JavaScript it might be similar to this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var exports = {};
(function() {
  var a = 10;
  exports.foo = a * 10;
})();

console.log(exports.a);   // undefined
console.log(exports.foo); // 100
{% endhighlight %}

Notice the ```(function () {/* module code here*/} )();```. This provides a new scope for the module to prevent pollution of the global object.

If written into a node module, this would be written as:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a = 10;
exports.foo = a * 10;
{% endhighlight %}

## Require a node module

In this lab we'll ```require()``` a file into our project.  

First create a folder called ```/planets```.  
Inside of ```/planets```, create a  file called ```circle.js``` with the following contents:

{% highlight javascript %}
var PI = Math.PI;

exports.area = function (r) {
  return PI * r * r;
};

exports.circumference = function (r) {
  return 2 * PI * r;
};
{% endhighlight %}

The module ```circle.js``` has exported the functions ```area()``` and ```circumference()```. To export an object, add to the special exports object.  Variables local to the module will be private. In this example the variable ```PI``` is private to ```circle.js```.


Next add another file to ```/planets``` called ```earth.js``` with the following contents:

{% highlight javascript %}
var circle = require('./circle');
var radius = 6378.1;
console.log( 'The area of the planet earth is ' + circle.area(radius) + ' km2');
{% endhighlight %}

Now, run the app by typing ```node earth``` from within the ```planets``` directory. You should see the following:

{% highlight bash %}
The area of the planet earth is 127800490.57763624 km2
{% endhighlight %}

## Require a JSON file

A JSON file can be included in a project by doing a ```require('./data.json')```.  This is because ```.json``` files are parsed as JSON text files.
Let's modify the previous example by storing the radius of all the planets in a JSON file. 

In the ```planets``` directory, create a file called ```planets.json``` with the following contents:

{% highlight javascript %}
{
  "mercury": 2440,
  "venus":  6051,
  "earth":  6378,
  "mars":   3397,
  "jupiter": 71492,
  "saturn": 60268,
  "uranus": 25559,
  "neptune": 24764
}
{% endhighlight %}

View the ```planets.json``` file by firing up a node shell (```node``` without arguments) from within the ```/planets``` directory and typing the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var planets = require('./planets.json');
planets.neptune;
{% endhighlight %}

Try to output the radius of some other planets.

Once you are comfortable with ```planets.json``` object,  update the ```earth.js``` example by importing ```planets.json``` into ```earth.js```.

{% highlight javascript %}
var planets = require('./planets.json');
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, update ```earth.js``` to use the circumference stored in ```planets.json```.


## Require a core module

Node has several modules compiled into the binary. The core modules are defined in node's source in the ```lib/``` folder.
Core modules are always preferentially loaded if their identifier is passed to ```require()```. For instance, ```require('http')``` will always return the built in HTTP module, even if there is a file by that name.

Let's use the core module assert to test ```circle.js```.  In the ```planets/``` folder, create a file called ```test.js```.  
In ```test.js```, require the ```assert``` module and ```circle.js``` to test the ```circle.area``` and ```circle.circumference``` methods.

{% highlight javascript %}
var assert = require('assert');
var circle = require('./circle');
{% endhighlight %}

Next write a couple tests using the [documentation for assert](http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html)

## Require a module from the node_modules directory

Modules can be installed using the node package manager, npm, to be included into your application.
For the next example, let's print out the planets in order of size. To do this, we'll include the ```underscore.js``` module. First we need to install underscore by executing the following command from within the ```planets/``` directory.

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install underscore
{% endhighlight %}

Now create a file called ```size.js``` and add the following:

{% highlight javascript %}
var sortBy = require('underscore').sortBy,
    keys = require('underscore').keys,
    planets = require('./planets.json');

planets = sortBy(keys(planets), function(k) { return planets[k]; })

console.log(planets);
{% endhighlight %}

See [underscore.js documentation](http://underscorejs.org/#sortBy).
