# Asynchronous patterns in Node.js

## A common problem and solution

First, let's see the problem we're trying to avoid:

Let's start by creating a few files in a brand new directory. Use the name of the files below and the contents as described for this example. The numeric names of the file are used to help clarify the point being made.

`0.html`
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Joe Andaverde</span>
<p class="bio">Joe is a Software Engineer for Softek Solutions, Inc. He's passionate about sharing his knowledge with others.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

`1.html`
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Dusty Burwell</span>
<p class="bio">Dusty is a dude.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
    if (err) return;

    var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
    
    if (matches) {
        var name = matches[1];
        var bio = matches[2];
        fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that the only file created was `3.json`. This is because the callback from read file doesn't actually get executed until the loop has completed. In which case, with the name being the integer value of the loop all files are saved with the terminating value of i. 

How do we avoid this? The important concept here is how scope is handled in JavaScript. Unlike other languages with block level scope using curly braces JavaScript's scope is at a function level only. We could get around this problem by introducing a new scope in each iteration of the loop to capture the value of i at that moment. Here's how you can avoid that situation:

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  (function (i) { //Create a new scope that takes a single argument
      fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
        if (err) return;

        var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
        
        if (matches) {
            var name = matches[1];
            var bio = matches[2];
            fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
        }
      });
  })(i);//Execute this function with the current value of i
}
{% endhighlight %}

The lesson to be learned here is that scopes are your best friend when performing asynchronous actions in JavaScript.

## Calls that must happen serially

More often than not there's a need to invoke a set of tasks asynchronously and then start a new set of tasks after completion. There are a variety of libraries that help with performing this situation and cleaning up the code a lot. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var bios = [];
var biosParsed = 0;
var biosToParse = ["1.html", "2.html"];

var saveBios = function (bios) {
  for (var i = 0; i < bios.length; i++) {
    fs.writeFile(bios[i].name + ".txt", JSON.stringify(bios[i]));  
  }
};

for (var i = 0; i < biosToParse.length; i++) {
  (function (fileName) {
    fs.readFile(fileName, function (err, data) {

      var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
      
      if (matches) {
        bios.push({
          name: matches[1],
          bio: matches[2]
        });
      }

      biosParsed++;
      
      //Have all pending callbacks been invoked?
      if (biosParsed == biosToParse.length) {
        //Save bios now that all async actions have completed
        saveBios(bios);
      }
    });
  })(biosToParse[i]);
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above note that we keep track of how many times the readFile callback is invoked. Once the value matches the number of callbacks we're waiting on we can continue with saving off the bios. This can get quite ugly the more complex your application becomes. A very good library for dealing with this is `async`. Here's an example of how async could be used to clean up the code above.

First, you should install the async module.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install async
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var async = require('async');
var biosToParse = ["1.html", "2.html"];

var saveBios = function (bios) {
  for (var i = 0; i < bios.length; i++) {
    fs.writeFile(bios[i].name + ".txt", JSON.stringify(bios[i]));  
  }
};

var parseOperations = [];

for (var i = 0; i < biosToParse.length; i++) {
  parseOperations.push((function (fileName) {
    return function (callback) {
      fs.readFile(fileName, function (err, data) {
        var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
        
        //The first argument by convention is the error
        //The second argument is aggregated with all other async results
        callback(null, {
          name: matches[1],
          bio: matches[2]
        });
      });
    };
  })(biosToParse[i]));
}

async.parallel(parseOperations, function (err, results) {
  saveBios(results)
});
{% endhighlight %}
