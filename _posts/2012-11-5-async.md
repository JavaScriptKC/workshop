# Asynchronous patterns in Node.js

## A common problem and solution

First, let's see the problem we're trying to avoid:

Let's start by creating a few files in a brand new directory. Use the name of the files below and the contents as described for this example. The numeric names of the file are used to help clarify the point being made.

`1.html`
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Joe Andaverde</span>
<p class="bio">Joe is a Software Engineer for Softek Solutions, Inc. He's passionate about sharing his knowledge with others.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

`2.html`
{% highlight html %}
<span class="Speaker">Dusty Burwell</span>
<p class="bio">Dusty is a dude.</p>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
    if (err) return;

    var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
    
    if (matches) {
        var name = matches[1];
        var bio = matches[2];
        fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
    }
  });
}
{% endhighlight %}

Go back to your command window and list files in your current working directory. Notice that the only file created was `3.json`. This is because the callback from read file doesn't actually get executed until the loop has completed. Any other statements after the for loop would also be executed before the callback. This is, in part, because Node is single threaded. The event loop hasn't had a chance to invoke your callback. In any case, all of the callbacks are being fired and overwriting `3.json`.

How do we avoid this? The important concept here is how scope is handled in JavaScript. Unlike other languages that use block level scope, JavaScript's scope is at a function level. We can get around this problem by introducing a new scope in each iteration of the loop to capture the value of `i` at that moment:

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');

for (var i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  (function (i) { //Create a new scope that takes a single argument
      fs.readFile(i + ".html", function (err, data) {
        if (err) return;

        var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
        
        if (matches) {
            var name = matches[1];
            var bio = matches[2];
            fs.writeFile(i + '.json', JSON.stringify({name: name, bio: bio}, null, 2));
        }
      });
  })(i);//Execute this function with the current value of i
}
{% endhighlight %}

The lesson to be learned here is that new scopes are your best friend when performing asynchronous actions in JavaScript.

## Asynchronous calls in parallel and then joining them

More often than not there's a need to invoke a set of tasks asynchronously and then start a new set of tasks after completion. There are a variety of libraries that help with performing this situation and cleaning up the code a lot. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var bios = [];
var biosParsed = 0;
var biosToParse = ["1.html", "2.html"];

var saveBios = function (bios) {
  for (var i = 0; i < bios.length; i++) {
    fs.writeFile(bios[i].name + ".txt", JSON.stringify(bios[i]));  
  }
};

for (var i = 0; i < biosToParse.length; i++) {
  (function (fileName) {
    fs.readFile(fileName, function (err, data) {

      var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
      
      if (matches) {
        bios.push({
          name: matches[1],
          bio: matches[2]
        });
      }

      biosParsed++;
      
      //Have all pending callbacks been invoked?
      if (biosParsed == biosToParse.length) {
        //Save bios now that all async actions have completed
        saveBios(bios);
      }
    });
  })(biosToParse[i]);
}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, note that we keep track of how many times the `readFile` callback is invoked. Once the value matches the number of callbacks we're waiting on we can continue with saving off the biographies. This can get quite ugly the more complex your application becomes. A very good library for dealing with this is `async`. Here's an example of how async could be used to clean up the code above.

First, you should install the async module.

{% highlight bash %}
npm install async
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
var fs = require('fs');
var async = require('async');
var biosToParse = ["1.html", "2.html"];

var saveBios = function (bios) {
  for (var i = 0; i < bios.length; i++) {
    fs.writeFile(bios[i].name + ".txt", JSON.stringify(bios[i]));  
  }
};

var parseOperations = [];

for (var i = 0; i < biosToParse.length; i++) {
  parseOperations.push((function (fileName) {
    return function (callback) {
      fs.readFile(fileName, function (err, data) {
        var matches = data.toString().match(/<span class=\"Speaker\">([\s\S]+)<\/span>[\s\S]+<p class=\"bio\">([\s\S]+)<\/p>/i);
        
        //The first argument by convention is the error
        //The second argument is aggregated with all other async results
        callback(null, {
          name: matches[1],
          bio: matches[2]
        });
      });
    };
  })(biosToParse[i]));
}

async.parallel(parseOperations, function (err, results) {
  saveBios(results)
});
{% endhighlight %}

Imagine the above where you had multiple things needing to happen in parallel. Remember how we kept around the `biosParsed` counter a few examples back? Keeping track of all the counters for more complicated examples could get extremely messy. Using `async` we're able to avoid these arbitrary counters and organize our code better. Another pattern to use is called `promises`.
