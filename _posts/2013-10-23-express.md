# Express Web Application Framework

Express is a commonly used framework for building web applications with Node. We'll show in this lab how to structure a simple Express application.

# Bootstrapping Express

Express requires a little configuration to get started. To start, let's focus on serving a static HTML page. This won't require any add-ons to Express or complicated configuration.

Create a new directory for this lab. We'll need to install the Express NPM module. To start this process generate a `package.json` file using the following command from the new directory:

{% highlight bash %}
> npm init
{% endhighlight %}

Run through the prompts supplying whatever values you like. Follow that up with installing the Express module:

{% highlight bash %}
> npm install express --save
{% endhighlight %}

This will add the Express module to your `package.json` file (because you provided --save). This will allow you to simply type npm install in the future to pull down the necessary dependency to start the application.

Now, create a file called `server.js` -- this file is what will bootstrap our Express based application.

Here's the simplest application:

{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000);
{% endhighlight %}

Now to start the server simply run the following command and browse to `http://localhost:3000/`.

{% highlight bash %}
> node server.js
{% endhighlight %}

# We need more!

Alright, so we're responding to every request for the root path with `Hello World!`, now let's introduce a templating engine.

A popular template engine of choice is Jade. To add Jade functionality let's install the module and save it to the `package.json` file.

{% highlight bash %}
> npm install jade --save
{% endhighlight %}

Now that the module is installed we need to configure Express to use it to render our views. This is done by using the `app.engine` function.

{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.engine('jade', require('jade').__express);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	res.render('index.jade');
});

app.listen(3000);
{% endhighlight %}

At this point we need to add a directory called `views` and create a file called `index.jade` with the following contents:

{% highlight javascript %}
html
  head
    title The page title
   body Hello world from Jade! 
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's push some data to the view. This can be done by passing a second argument to the `render` call in `server.js`. 

{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.engine('jade', require('jade').__express);

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	res.render('index.jade', {name: 'Joe'});
});

app.listen(3000);
{% endhighlight %}

Now let's make use of this object in `index.jade`. Take note of the `=` character. This allows you to print the value on the right hand side to the page.

{% highlight javascript %}
html
   head
      title The title goes here!
   body 
      p Hello 
      h2= name
{% endhighlight %}
