# Exercises to put it all together

You\'re now ready to try some exercises on your own. Clone [https://github.com/nodekc/workshop-exercises](https://github.com/nodekc/workshop-exercises) to get started. Each exercise is in its own folder with a README that describes what to do. Example solutions are provided in the `solutions` folder. Try to avoid looking in there unless you\'re completely stumped.

Good luck and happy learning!
