**Welcome to Node Labs!** This workshop is intended to work much like a lab or recitation course at a university. There will be instructors (designated by a Node Labs t-shirt) milling about throughout the workshop who will be checking in to make sure you're not stuck and to answer your questions.

First things first: you should have node.js installed on your computer and available on your PATH. If you do not, please [download node.js now](http://nodejs.org/download).

To ensure that you have node.js installed, open a command prompt and make sure the following commands exist and are at least the versions below:

{% highlight bash %}
$ node --version
v0.10.5

$ npm --version
1.2.18
{% endhighlight %}

  <div class="userprompt continue">
    <!-- Please don't just skip through these, actually do the labs! -->
    <a href="{{ site.posts.last.url }}">Awesome, let's get started!<span>{{ site.posts.last.title }}</span></a>
