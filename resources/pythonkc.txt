Hey,

Yeah, it was a 2 day event which I think is important.  We hosted it at
UMKC, they were very receptive and a great host, they might be able to help
you out as well.

First night schedule went like this:

   - Intro about the group / workshop.  Quick example of tutorial
   - All members went through a self-guided tutorial to setup Python on
   their system and walk though a set of exercises to get familiar with the
   language.
   - Once they completed that they just had to check off with an aide and
   they were free to go.

We followed this material on Friday night:
http://beginners-python-workshop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html

Saturday started off with a 2 hour Intro to Python presentation, the lunch
and then we all broke up into groups and did projects.  We had a Django /
web dev project, twitter api project and a few others.

Overall I think it went really well.  We definitely got very technical but
at a beginners level.  We had about 50 attendees and there were about 6
helpers, and that was plenty.

Good luck!  Let me know if you need anything else.
